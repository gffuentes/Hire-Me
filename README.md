#GitHub Venga Mission
---

1. Sign-up for a GitHub account

2. Get Git working locally on your computer (do not install the Windows or Mac GitHub client. Do strictly through the Command Line or Terminal)

3. Create a repository using your new GitHub account with whatever name you would like - be creative!

4. Create a directory on your computer and initialize Git within that folder.

5. Create a README.md file within that directory and write a quick cover letter using markdown (the more syntax you can show you learned, the better)

6. Push your directory to your GitHub repository

**Thats it! Well done! You are one step closer to becoming Venga's newest hire! Give yourself a pat on the back! See you soon!**
