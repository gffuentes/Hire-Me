#GitHub Venga Mission
---

1. Sign-up for a GitHub account

2. Get Git working locally on your computer (Do not install the Windows or Mac GitHub client. Also, do not just upload directly to the website. We want you to try pushing straight from the Terminal/Command Line)

3. Create a repository using your new GitHub account with whatever name you would like - be creative!

4. Create a directory on your computer and initialize Git within that folder.

5. Create a README.md file within that directory and write a quick cover letter using markdown (the more syntax you can show you learned, the better)

6. Push your directory to your GitHub repository

**Thats it! Well done! You are one step closer to becoming Venga's newest hire! Give yourself a pat on the back! See you soon!**
